# AIllustrator-Translate/v1.0
Scripts to translate text inside Illustrator, getting DB text translate.

## Why?
Easy, sometimes there are business that work with Adobe products, creating posters, advertisings, restaurant menu desings... In general graphic design.
So I decided to make the workflow better and less repetitive, because till now, where I work, designers must do the same work as many times as languages client request. That means a designer have to create a menu restaurant desing for example 5 times, because it has 5 different languages: Spanish, English, German, Italian and French.

## How to use it
To use this, first of all you must have all **.jsx** files inside /InstallationPath/**Adobe/AdobeIllustrator/Scripting/Sample Scripts/JavaScript/Working With Text** folder. Another way to use it without installing it inside Adobe, is using Ctrl+F12 and Searching it by yourself. Once you have this Ok it's time to start.
